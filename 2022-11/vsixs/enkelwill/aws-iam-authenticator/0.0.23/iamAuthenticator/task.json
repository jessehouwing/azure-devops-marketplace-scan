When using environment variables in the build agent process you may use the standard AWS environment variables: _AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID_, _AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY_ and optionally _AWS_SESSION_TOKEN_.\n* If the build agent is running on an Amazon EC2 instance, from the instance metadata associated with the EC2 instance. For credentials to be available from EC2 instance metadata the instance must have been started with an instance profile referencing a role granting permissions to the task to make calls to AWS on your behalf.
